IMPORTANT: Generate statements in the SAME LANGUAGE as the input text. If the input is in Chinese, generate Chinese statements. If the input is in English, generate English statements. Do not translate or change the language. Maintain the original language throughout your response.

Example:
Example text: 
Our new laptop model features a high-resolution Retina display for crystal-clear visuals. It also includes a fast-charging battery, giving you up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge. For security, weâ€™ve added fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD. Plus, every purchase comes with a one-year warranty and 24/7 customer support.

    @staticmethod
    def generate_verdicts(user_input: str, statements: List[str]):
        return f"""For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Please generate a list of JSON with two keys: `verdict` and `reason`.

IMPORTANT: When providing reasons, use the SAME LANGUAGE as the input. If the input is in Chinese, provide reasons in Chinese. If the input is in English, provide reasons in English.
The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either a 'yes', 'idk' or 'no'. Answer 'yes' if the statement is relevant to addressing the original input, 'no' if the statement is irrelevant, and 'idk' if it is ambiguous (eg., not directly relevant but could be used as a supporting point to address the input).
The 'reason' is the reason for the verdict.
Provide a 'reason' ONLY if the answer is 'no'. 
The provided statements are statements made in the actual output.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key mapping to a list of JSON objects.
Example input: 
What features does the new laptop have?

Example statements: 
[
    "The new laptop model has a high-resolution Retina display.",
    "It includes a fast-charging battery with up to 12 hours of usage.",
    "Security features include fingerprint authentication and an encrypted SSD.",
    "Every purchase comes with a one-year warranty.",
    "24/7 customer support is included.",
    "Pineapples taste great on pizza."
]

Example JSON:
{{
    "verdicts": [
        {{
            "verdict": "yes"
        }},
        {{
            "verdict": "yes"
        }},
        {{
            "verdict": "yes"
        }},
        {{
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "A one-year warranty is a purchase benefit, not a feature of the laptop itself."
        }},
        {{
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "Customer support is a service, not a feature of the laptop."
        }},
        {{
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The statement about pineapples on pizza is completely irrelevant to the input, which asks about laptop features."
        }}
    ]  
}}

Since you are going to generate a verdict for each statement, the number of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL to the number of `statements`.
