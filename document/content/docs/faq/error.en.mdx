1. ### "Current group upstream load is saturated, please try again later" (request id: 202407100753411462086782835521)

This is an OneAPI channel issue. Try switching to a different model or a different relay provider.

1. ### "Connection Error" in logs when using the API

Most likely the API key is pointing to OpenAI's API, but the server is deployed in mainland China and can't reach overseas endpoints. Use a relay service or reverse proxy to resolve the connectivity issue.
