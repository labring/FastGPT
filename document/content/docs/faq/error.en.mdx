1. ### Current group upstream load is saturated, please try again later (request id:202407100753411462086782835521)

This is an OneAPI channel issue. You can switch to a different model or use a different relay service.

1. ### Connection Error in logs when using API

Most likely the api-key was filled with openapi, and the deployed server is in China and cannot access overseas APIs. You can use a relay or reverse proxy to solve the access issue.
