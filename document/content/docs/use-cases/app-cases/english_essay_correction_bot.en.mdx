FastGPT provides a straightforward way to build applications powered by LLM models.

This article demonstrates how to use **Workflows** by building an English essay correction bot.

## Building Process

### 1. Create a Workflow

You can start from the *Multi-turn Translation Bot* template.

> The Multi-turn Translation Bot was created by @米开朗基杨 — also a great workflow worth studying.

### 2. Get Input and Analyze with LLM

We want the LLM to process text and return structured data that we handle ourselves.

The **System Prompt** is the most critical parameter. Here is a reference prompt:

~~~markdown
## Role
Senior English Writing Expert

## Task
Analyze the input text. Find all types of errors, including but not limited to spelling mistakes and grammar errors.
Note: Ignore spacing issues around punctuation.
Note: For sentences with errors, the suggestion should identify the specific part of the sentence and propose what to replace it with.

## Output Format
Do not use Markdown syntax. Output in JSON format.
Output the "reason" field in Chinese.
Directly output a list whose members are objects of the same type, defined as follows:
```
{
"raw": string; // the original text
"reason": string; // the reason
"suggestion": string; // suggested correction
}
```
~~~

You can disable AI reply in the model selection window.

This hides the raw JSON output from the user.

### 3. Data Processing

The LLM outputs JSON, which needs further processing. Use the Code Execution module for this.

```javascript
function main({data}){
    const array = JSON.parse(data)
    return {
        content: array.map(
            (item, index) => {
                return `
## Analysis ${index+1}
- **Error**: ${item.raw}
- **Analysis**: ${item.reason}
- **Suggestion**: ${item.suggestion}
`
            }
        ).join('')
    }
}
```

The code parses the JSON into an object, then concatenates it into a Markdown-formatted string.

FastGPT's Specified Reply module renders Markdown as HTML in the response.

## Publishing

Publish through the available publishing channels.
