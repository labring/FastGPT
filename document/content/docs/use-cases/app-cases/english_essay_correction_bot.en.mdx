FastGPT provides a simple way to build applications based on LLM Models.

This article introduces how to use **Workflows** by building an English essay correction bot.

## Build Process

### 1. Create Workflow

You can start by creating from *Multi-turn Translation Bot*.

> The Multi-turn Translation Bot was created by @米开朗基杨, and it's also a workflow worth learning from.

### 2. Get Input and Analyze with LLM

We want the LLM to process text and return structured data that we can handle ourselves.

**Prompt** is the most important parameter. The prompt provided here is for reference only:

~~~markdown
## Role
Senior English writing expert

## Task
Analyze the input text. Find various errors, including but not limited to spelling mistakes, grammar errors, etc.
Note: Ignore spacing issues around punctuation marks.
Note: For sentences with errors, the modification suggestion should point out the specific part of the sentence, then propose what to replace that part with.

## Output Format
Don't use Markdown syntax, output JSON format content.
Output "reason" content in Chinese.
Directly output a list whose members are objects of the same type, defined as follows:
```
{
"raw": string; // Represents the original text
"reason": string; // Represents the reason
"suggestion": string; // Modification suggestion
}
```
~~~

You can disable AI replies in the model selection window.

This way you won't see the output JSON format content.

### 3. Data Processing

The LLM above outputs JSON, which needs data processing here. Data processing can use the code execution component.

```javascript
function main({data}){
    const array = JSON.parse(data)
    return {
        content: array.map(
            (item, index) => {
                return `
## Analysis ${index+1}
- **Error**: ${item.raw}
- **Analysis**: ${item.reason}
- **Modification Suggestion**: ${item.suggestion}
`
            }
        ).join('')
    }
}
```

The code above parses JSON into an Object, then concatenates it into a Markdown syntax string.

FastGPT's specified reply component can parse Markdown into HTML for return.

## Publish

You can publish using publishing channels.
