## What Templates Can Be Merged

Currently, application templates merged into the repository are displayed to all users in the「Template Market」.

To control template quality and avoid overwhelming users with too many options, not all templates will be merged into the open-source repository. You can PR in advance to discuss the template content with us.

We estimate the total number won't be very large—around 50 templates, half from the FastGPT Team and half from community users.

## How to Write an Application Template

### 1. Set Up FastGPT and FastGPT-plugin Development Environments

You need to perform the following operations in the dev environment.

Refer to these two documents to run FastGPT and FastGPT-plugin development environments locally:
- [FastGPT｜Quick Start Local Development](/docs/introduction/development/intro/)
- [How to Develop System Plugins](/docs/introduction/guide/plugins/dev_system_tool/)

### 2. Create Application Template

In the FastGPT-plugin project, application templates are in the `modules/workflow/templates` directory.
1. Create a new `.json` file
2. Copy the following content and paste it into the newly created `.json` file

```json
{
  "name": "Template Name",
  "intro": "Template description, displayed on the template market page",
  "author": "Your name",
  "avatar": "Template avatar, you can place the image file in the same folder and fill in the corresponding path",

  "tags": ["Template tags"], // writing(text creation), image-generation(image generation), web-search(web search),
  // roleplay(role-playing), office-services(office services) - currently 5 categories, choose the appropriate tag

  "type": "Template category", // simple(simple app), advanced(workflow), plugin(plugin)

  "workflow": {
    // Ignore this object for now, we'll paste the exported workflow later
    "nodes": [],
    "edges": [],
    "chatConfig": {}
  }
}
```


### 3. Complete Template Orchestration and Testing

1. Orchestrate the workflow in FastGPT (can be done in the cloud service version or locally deployed version).

### 4. Copy Configuration to template.json

Hover your mouse over the application avatar and name in the top left corner. A dropdown menu will appear where you can export the workflow configuration.

The exported configuration is automatically copied to the clipboard. You can paste it directly into the template.json file, replacing the **workflow** value from step 2.

### 5. Verify Template Loads Successfully

Refresh the page, open the template market, check if it loads successfully, and click「Use」to test its functionality.

### 6. Deploy and Use

After completing the above operations, you can package the fastgpt-plugin image for use. Currently, templates don't support hot updates—all templates are packaged in the image.

If you don't want to repackage the fastgpt-plugin image every time you update templates, you can mount the .json file to the `/app/workflows/` directory in the container using Docker volume mounting.

### 7. Submit PR

If you think your template should be submitted to the open-source repository, you can submit it via PR.

- Clearly describe the template's introduction and functionality
- Include screenshots of the template in action
- Explain template parameter configuration clearly in the PR. For example, if some templates require applying for a key from a provider, attach the corresponding address and tutorial—we'll add it to the documentation later.
