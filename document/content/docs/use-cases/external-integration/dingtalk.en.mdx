Starting from version 4.8.16, FastGPT commercial edition supports direct DingTalk bot integration without additional APIs.

## 1. Create a DingTalk Internal Enterprise App

1. Create an internal enterprise app in the [DingTalk Developer Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app).

## 2. Add a Publishing Channel in FastGPT

In FastGPT, select the app you want to integrate. On the **Publishing Channels** page, create a new DingTalk bot publishing channel.

Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained earlier into the configuration dialog.

After debugging, click **Publish**.

## 5. Publish the App

After the bot is published, you still need to publish the app version on the **Version Management and Publishing** page.

Once the app is published, you can use the bot within your DingTalk enterprise. You can chat with the bot privately, or add the bot to a group and `@mention the bot` to start a conversation.
