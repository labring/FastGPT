## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Update Images:

- Update FastGPT commercial edition image tag: v4.12.2-fix3

## New Features

1. Embedding model concurrency settings — no longer hardcoded to 10, since some embedding models don't support concurrency. Default is now 1, configurable in model settings.
2. Chat page: admins can configure featured apps to recommend to team members.
3. Chat page home: admins can configure shortcut apps for commonly used team applications.
4. Support for disabling the team chat homepage.

## Improvements

1. Added anomaly detection for **isolated branches** in workflows.
2. When truncating embedding vectors above 1536 dimensions, normalization is now enforced. For other dimensions, normalization is determined entirely by configuration, reducing unnecessary automatic computation.
3. Moved model provider configuration into the plugin SDK.
4. Encapsulated LLM call functions to simplify LLM requests and tool calls.
5. Optimized workflow scheduling code to avoid deep recursion.
6. Improved workflow recursion detection with grouped checks on recursive paths, supporting more diverse connection patterns.

## Bug Fixes

1. Standalone chat page: various UI issues.
2. Standalone chat page: plugin interactions could not be rendered.
3. Standalone chat page: incorrect default URL when using sub-routes.
4. Multi-select picker causing page crashes.
5. Mobile: shared links incorrectly loaded the authenticated chat page navigation.
6. User sync could encounter write conflict issues.
7. System plans could not be fully disabled — empty object defaults caused authentication errors.
8. Workflow: searching for team apps was not working.
9. App versions: incorrect `ref` field prevented normal usage.
10. OceanBase: batch inserts did not correctly return inserted IDs.
11. Interaction nodes conflicted with toolsets, causing toolsets to malfunction after an interaction node.

## Tool Updates

1. Doc2x tool: incorrect response values.
