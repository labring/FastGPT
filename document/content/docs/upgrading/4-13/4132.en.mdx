## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Update Images:

- Update FastGPT image tag: v4.13.2
- Update FastGPT commercial edition image tag: v4.13.2
- Update fastgpt-plugin image tag: v0.2.4
- mcp_server: no update needed
- Sandbox: no update needed
- AIProxy: no update needed

### 2. Add FastGPT/FastGPT-pro Environment Variables

```
S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET=fastgpt-public # (Public read bucket name, corresponds to the previous S3_TOOL_BUCKET in the plugin project)
S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET=fastgpt-private # (Private read/write bucket name, corresponds to the previous S3_PLUGIN_BUCKET in the plugin project)
```

### 3. Fix fastgpt-plugin Environment Variables

- Rename S3_TOOL_BUCKET to S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET
- Rename S3_PLUGIN_BUCKET to S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET

### 4. Run the Upgrade Script

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv4132' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will remove the previous S3 circleLife policy. If you are using an external S3 service that does not support circleLife operations, this script may fail -- you can safely ignore the error (since setting the policy would have also failed).
