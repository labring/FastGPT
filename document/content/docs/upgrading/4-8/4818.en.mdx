title: V4.8.18 (Includes Migration Script)
description: FastGPT V4.8.18 Release Notes
---

## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Update images:

- Update the fastgpt image tag to v4.8.18-fix
- Update the fastgpt-pro commercial edition image tag to v4.8.18-fix
- Sandbox image update is not required

### 2. Run migration script

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv4818' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This migrates the full-text search table. The migration takes a while — full-text search will be unavailable during the process. The log will print the amount of data already migrated.
