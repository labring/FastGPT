## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Back up your database

### 2. Update images

- Update the FastGPT image tag to v4.8.9
- Update the FastGPT commercial edition image tag to v4.8.9
- Sandbox image update is optional

### 3. Run initialization (Commercial Edition)

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/init/489' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This initializes notification methods for multi-tenancy (internal use only, no action needed).

## V4.8.9 Release Notes

1. New - File upload configuration. Image upload capability is now determined by system configuration rather than relying on vision model availability.
2. New - AI chat node and tool calls support toggling "Enable image recognition". When enabled, it automatically retrieves images uploaded in the chat and image URLs from "User question".
3. New - Document parsing node.
4. Commercial - Team notification account binding for receiving important messages.
5. Commercial - Knowledge Base collection tagging for tag-based management.
6. Commercial - Knowledge Base search node supports tag filtering and creation date filtering.
7. Commercial - Transfer app owner permissions.
