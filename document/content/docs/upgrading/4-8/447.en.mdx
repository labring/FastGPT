## Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your domain):

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv447

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv447' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This initializes PostgreSQL indexes and converts empty `file_id` objects to `manual` objects. If you have a large dataset, this may take a while — you can monitor progress via logs.
