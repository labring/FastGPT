## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Back up your database

### 2. Update images

- Update the fastgpt image tag to v4.8.8-fix2
- Update the commercial edition image tag to v4.8.8

### 3. Run initialization

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv488' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will initialize inherited permissions for Knowledge Bases.

2. New - DuckDuckGo system plugin.
3. New - Lark webhook system plugin.

7. Improved - Node icons.
8. Improved - Added a dedicated copy button to chat references for easier copying. Added collapsible reference content.
