## Sealos Upgrade Instructions

1. Create a new app in App Management with the image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/fastgpt/fastgpt-sandbox:v4.8.1
2. No external access URL is needed. Set the port to 3000.
3. After deployment, copy the app's internal network address.
4. Click "Update" on FastGPT, modify the environment variables, and add the following:

```
SANDBOX_URL=internal-network-address
```

## Docker Deployment

You can pull the latest [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/labring/FastGPT/blob/main/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml) file for reference.

1. Add a new `sandbox` container.
2. Add the `SANDBOX_URL` environment variable to the fastgpt and fastgpt-pro (commercial edition) containers.
3. It's recommended not to expose the sandbox to the public network, as it has no credential verification.

2. New - Content extraction node now supports data type selection.
3. Fixed - Newly added site sync not working.
