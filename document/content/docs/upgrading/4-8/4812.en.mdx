title: V4.8.12 (Includes Migration Script)
description: FastGPT V4.8.12 Release Notes
---

## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Back up your data

### 2. Update images

- Update the FastGPT image tag to v4.8.12-fix
- Update the FastGPT admin image tag to v4.8.12 (fastgpt-pro image)
- Sandbox image update is optional


### 3. Run initialization (Commercial Edition)

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/init/4812' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This initializes member group data for apps and Knowledge Bases.

### 4. Rebuild Milvus data

Due to JavaScript int64 precision loss, users who previously deployed with Milvus or Zilliz and experienced data precision loss need to rebuild their Milvus data. (Check the `dataset_datas` collection — if `dataId` values in the `indexes` field have trailing precision loss, a rebuild is needed.) PG users do not need to take action.

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/resetMilvus' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
