description: FastGPT V4.8.23 Release Notes
---

## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Back up your database

### 2. Update images:

- Update the fastgpt image tag to v4.8.23-fix
- Update the fastgpt-pro commercial edition image tag to v4.8.23-fix
- Sandbox image update is not required

### 3. Run migration script

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv4823' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

The script cleans up Knowledge Base dirty data, primarily redundant full-text indexes.

## New Features

1. Added default "Knowledge Base text understanding model" configuration.
2. AI Proxy V1, which can replace OneAPI and provides complete model call logs for easier troubleshooting.
3. Added support ticket entry point.

## Improvements

1. Model configuration form now includes required field validation.
2. Collection list data statistics method improved for better performance with large datasets.
3. Optimized math formulas: LaTeX format is now escaped to Markdown format.
4. Document image parsing: oversized images are now automatically skipped.
5. Time picker: start time defaults to 00:00:00 and end time to 23:59:59 for the selected day, preventing UI/logic discrepancies.
6. Upgraded mongoose library dependency.

2. Temporarily removed Markdown reading optimization to prevent link splitting errors.
