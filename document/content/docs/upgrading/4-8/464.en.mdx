## 1. Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your domain).

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv464

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv464' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

What the initialization does:

1. Initializes the createTime field in PG.
2. Initializes the feedback field for chats in Mongo.

## V4.6.4 New Features

1. Rewritten - Share link identity logic, now using localID to track user IDs.
2. New (Commercial edition) - Share link SSO support. With just 3 API endpoints via an authentication URL, you can fully integrate your existing user system. See [Share Link Authentication](/docs/openapi/share/) for details.
3. New - More embedding options for share links, with additional DIY customization.
4. Improved - History module. The old history module has been deprecated — simply enter the value directly in the relevant field.
5. Adjusted - Knowledge base search module topK logic now uses MaxToken calculation, accommodating text chunks of varying lengths.
6. Adjusted - Authentication order to prioritize API keys, preventing cookies from overriding API key authentication.
7. Link fetching now supports multiple selectors. See [Web Site Sync Usage](/docs/introduction/guide/knowledge_base/websync/).
8. Fixed - Image upload authentication issue in share links.
9. Fixed - Mongo connection pool not being released.
10. Fixed - Dataset description (Intro) not updating.
11. Fixed - Markdown code block rendering issue.
12. Fixed - Root permission issue.
