## Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (remember to include `headers.rootkey` — this value comes from your environment variables):

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv442

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv442' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will reinitialize the indexes on the MongoDB `Bill` collection, as the previous TTL expiration was incorrect.
