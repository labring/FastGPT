## 1. Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your domain).

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv467

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv467' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

What the initialization does:

1. Re-associates images with their datasets.
2. Sets null values in the PG table.

## V4.6.7 Release Notes

2. Optimized knowledge base and chat data indexing.
3. Knowledge base OpenAPI — you can now [manage knowledge bases via API](/docs/openapi/dataset).
4. New - Input field variable hints. After typing `{`, you'll see available variable suggestions. Based on community feedback on advanced orchestration, we plan to improve variable handling in the February release, adding support for node-scoped local variables and more global variables.

6. Fixed - chatId conflicts when using the API for conversations.
7. Fixed - Potential window.onLoad conflicts when embedding via iframe.
