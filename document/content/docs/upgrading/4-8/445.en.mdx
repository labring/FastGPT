## Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (remember to include `headers.rootkey` — this value comes from your environment variables):

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv445

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv445' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This initializes the variable module by merging it into the user guide module.

## What's New

### FastGPT V4.4.5

1. Added — Next-step suggestions: the model can now generate 3 predicted follow-up questions.
2. Commercial edition — Share link restrictions and hook-based identity verification (can integrate with your existing user system).
3. Commercial edition — API Key management: added alias, quota limits, and expiration. Includes a built-in appId, so no additional connection is needed.
4. Improved — Global variables and opening message merged into a single module.
