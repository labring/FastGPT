## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Back Up Your Database

### 2. Update Images

- Update the fastgpt image tag to v4.8.5
- Update the commercial edition image tag to v4.8.5

### 3. Run Initialization

From any terminal, send 1 HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv485' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will merge the plugin data table into the app table. The plugin table will not be deleted.
