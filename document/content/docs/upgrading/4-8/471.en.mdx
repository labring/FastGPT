description: FastGPT V4.7.1 Release Notes
---

## Initialization Script

From any terminal, send 1 HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your FastGPT domain.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/clearInvalidData' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This request runs stale data cleanup (removes invalid files, images, Knowledge Base collections, and vectors).

## Update Configuration File

Added Laf environment configuration. [View the latest configuration file](/docs/introduction/development/configuration/)

## V4.7.1 Release Notes

1. New - Full voice input configuration. Supports toggling voice input on/off (including on share pages), auto-send after voice input, and auto voice playback after input (streaming).
2. New - PPTX and XLSX file reading. Note that all file reading now happens server-side, which consumes more server resources and prevents content preview during upload.
3. New - Laf cloud function integration. You can use cloud functions from your Laf account as HTTP modules.
4. New - Scheduled cleanup timer for stale data. Uses incremental cleanup (cleans data from the last N hours), so keep the service running continuously. For a full cleanup after extended downtime, use the `clearInvalidData` endpoint.
5. Commercial Edition - Admin panel system notification configuration.
6. Improved - Knowledge Base export now supports IP-based mode.
7. Changed - CSV import template no longer validates headers; automatically reads the first two columns.
8. Fixed - Tool calling module connection data type validation error.
9. Fixed - Custom index input data destructuring failure.
10. Fixed - ReRank model data format.
11. Fixed - Query completion history bug.
12. Fixed - Share page slow loading in certain edge cases (caused by database connections not being triggered during SSR).
