## Initialization Script

From any terminal, send 1 HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your FastGPT domain.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv481' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Due to previously inconsistent collection names, this initialization will reset table names. Before running, make sure the `dataset.trainings` table has no data. It's best to pause all active operations before initializing to avoid data conflicts.

## Run Stale Data Cleanup

From any terminal, send 1 HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your FastGPT domain.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/clearInvalidData' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

After initialization, you can run this command. The previous scheduled cleanup timer had some issues and missed certain data. This allows you to trigger a full cleanup manually.

## V4.8.1 Release Notes

If you're using the Chat API, note that a new `event: updateVariables` event has been added for updating variables.
