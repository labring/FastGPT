### 3. Run Initialization

From any terminal, send 1 HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv486' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
