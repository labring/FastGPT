## Update Commercial Edition Environment Variables

Add the OneAPI address and token:

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://oneapi:3000/v1
CHAT_API_KEY=sk-fastgpt
```

## Initialization Script

From any terminal, send 1 HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your domain.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv469' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

1. Resets the usage tracking table.
2. Runs stale data cleanup (removes invalid files, images, Knowledge Base collections, and vectors).

## External API Updates

1. Due to billing system changes, the [share link chat reporting endpoint](/docs/openapi/share/#5-编写对话结果上报接口可选) requires some adjustments. The `price` field has been replaced by `totalPoints`. The `inputToken` and `outputToken` fields are no longer provided — only a `token` field (total token count) is returned.
