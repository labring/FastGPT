## New Workflow

FastGPT Workflow V2 is here, with a cleaner and more streamlined workflow experience.

<Alert icon="🤖" context="success">
**Due to significant workflow changes, many parts need to be manually rebuilt. Please rebuild plugins first, then apps.**

We recommend updating your workflows as soon as possible to avoid future compatibility issues as the platform continues to evolve.
</Alert>

A `version` field has been added to apps and plugins to distinguish between old and new workflows. After upgrading to V4.8, all saved and newly created workflows use the new version. Old workflows will show a reset prompt dialog. Workflows called via API or share links will continue to work until you save them again.

## Commercial Edition Configuration Update

Commercial edition users who have configured email verification codes need to update the admin panel: go to Admin Panel -> Project Settings -> Login Settings -> Email Login Settings -> update the **Email SMTP Server Address**. Previously only aliases were supported; now you can configure custom addresses. Here are some alias-to-address mappings:

qq: smtp.qq.com
gmail: smtp.gmail.com
