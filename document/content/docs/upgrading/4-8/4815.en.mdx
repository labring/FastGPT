## Upgrade Guide

- Update the fastgpt image tag to v4.8.15-fix3
- Update the fastgpt-pro commercial edition image tag to v4.8.15
- Sandbox image update is optional

## Run Migration Script

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv4815' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This resets the scheduled execution fields for apps, removing null values to reduce index size.

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/init/refreshFreeUser' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This recalculates free-tier user durations. A previous version upgrade did not recalculate time properly, which caused incorrect notifications.
