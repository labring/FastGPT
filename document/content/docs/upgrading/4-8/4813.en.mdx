title: V4.8.13
description: FastGPT V4.8.13 Release Notes
---

## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Back up your data

### 2. Update images

- Update the FastGPT image tag to v4.8.13-fix
- Update the FastGPT commercial edition image tag to v4.8.13-fix (fastgpt-pro image)
- Sandbox image update is optional

### 3. Add environment variables

- Add the environment variable `FE_DOMAIN=http://xx.com` to both the fastgpt and fastgpt-pro images. Set the value to the FastGPT frontend access URL (do not include a trailing `/`). This automatically prepends the domain to relative file paths.

### 4. Update file upload workflow configuration

While the old file upload workflow configuration is still supported, backward compatibility will be removed within the next two versions. Please update your workflows to use the new file upload logic as soon as possible. In particular, file passing in nested apps will no longer be automatic — you must explicitly specify which files to pass. For details, see: [File Upload Changes](/docs/introduction/guide/course/fileinput/#4813%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC%E8%B5%B7%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E4%B8%8A%E4%BC%A0%E7%9A%84%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0)
