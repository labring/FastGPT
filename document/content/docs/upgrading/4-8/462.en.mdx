## 1. Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your domain).

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv462

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv462' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

What the initialization does:

1. Initializes full-text indexing.

## V4.6.2 New Features

1. New - Full-text indexing (requires a ReRank model; working on making it available in the community edition — the model API is somewhat specialized).
2. New - Plugin sources (expected to be officially used in V4.7/V4.8).
3. Improved - PDF parsing.
4. Improved - DOCX file parsing, now converts to Markdown while preserving images.
5. Fixed and improved the TextSplitter function.
