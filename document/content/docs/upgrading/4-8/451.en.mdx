## Run the Initialization API

Send 1 HTTP request (replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your domain).

1. https://xxxxx/api/admin/initv451

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv451' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

What the initialization does:

1. Renames database fields.
2. Initializes knowledge base-related fields in the Mongo APP collection.
3. Initializes PG and Mongo content — creates a collection in Mongo for each file and assigns the references back to PG.

**This initialization endpoint may be very slow. If the request times out, don't worry — just check the logs.**
