## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Update Images:

- Update FastGPT image tag: v4.14.1
- Update FastGPT commercial edition image tag: v4.14.1
- Update fastgpt-plugin image tag: v0.3.1
- mcp_server: no update needed
- Sandbox: no update needed
- AIProxy: no update needed

### 2. Run the Upgrade Script

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv4141' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will create a copy of the original app directory for tool usage.

## New Features

1. New workbench interaction. The original "Plugin" has been renamed to "Workflow Tool" and moved under the My Tools category.
2. Workflows now provide a "Continue" button after running out of credits, so you don't have to start over.

## Improvements

1. MCP Client instances are now persisted within the same conversation turn and will not be destroyed.
2. When reloading models, the global model configuration is no longer cleared and re-added, which previously caused model call errors during the reload phase.
3. Auto-save now creates a team cloud save record.

## Bug Fixes

1. Interactive nodes did not work properly in debug mode.
2. Tab spacing was misaligned in the rich text editor.
3. When running nested Agents, the skip-node queue was not initialized, preventing normal execution.
4. Condition node threw an error when the right-side value was a number reference.
5. File selection input did not show the selection dialog when used as a workflow tool parameter.
6. HTTP plugin could not correctly handle HTTP (non-HTTPS) protocol requests.
7. UI issue with the default value editor for text-type global variables.
8. Code node content overlapped when exceeding 100 lines.
9. Deleting an app did not delete items inside its directory.
10. Browser did not pass the real-time date to the server.
