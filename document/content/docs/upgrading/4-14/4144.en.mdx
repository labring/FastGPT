## Upgrade Guide

### 1. Update Images:

- Update FastGPT image tag: v4.14.4
- Update FastGPT commercial edition image tag: v4.14.4
- Update fastgpt-plugin image tag: v0.3.4
- mcp_server: no update needed
- Sandbox: no update needed
- AIProxy: no update needed

### 2. Run the Upgrade Script

From any terminal, send an HTTP request. Replace `{{rootkey}}` with the `rootkey` from your environment variables, and `{{host}}` with your **FastGPT domain**.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://{{host}}/api/admin/initv4144' \
--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

1. Migrates files uploaded via the Dataset/local API (left over from 4.14.3) to S3.
2. Recalculates feedback for all existing chats and adds flags for filtering. This function runs slowly and is executed asynchronously -- the API will not return a result. Check the logs for the message: `Migration feedback completed!`

## New Features

1. Tool calls now support configurable streaming output.
2. AI credit alert notifications.
3. Chat logs now display IP geolocation.
4. Chat logs now display the app version name (if the version is updated mid-conversation, it will reflect the latest version).
5. Chat logs support filtering by thumbs up/down, with quick navigation to liked/disliked records in the chat details.
6. Upload local files to knowledge base via API, now saved to S3. All legacy GridFS code has been removed.
7. New subscription plan logic.
8. Configurable file whitelist for chat file uploads.
9. S3 now supports pathStyle and region configuration.
10. Support for multi-tenant custom domain configuration via Sealos.
11. File input in workflow tool references now supports manual entry (previously only variable references were supported).
12. Network proxy support (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY).

## Improvements

1. Increased S3 file upload timeout to 5 minutes.
2. Question optimization now uses JinaAI's marginal utility formula to find the search term with the highest marginal gain.
3. User notifications now support both Chinese and English, with improved templates.
4. Knowledge base deletion now uses an asynchronous queue-based approach.
5. Improved error messages for invalid images in LLM requests.
6. Completions API in non-stream mode with detail=false now includes `reason_content` in the response.
7. Added detection for invalid S3 keys.
8. Deleting apps and knowledge bases now requires entering the name for confirmation.
9. Mongo slow operation logs now accurately print the collection name and operation details.
10. Share link custom authentication: the returned uid is now limited to 200 characters max (longer values affected file uploads).

## Bug Fixes

1. Loop node arrays no longer filter out empty content.
2. Workflow tools did not pass custom DataId, causing "no permission" errors when viewing knowledge base during test runs.
3. In Chat Agent tool configuration, non-required boolean and number types could not be confirmed directly.
4. Workbench cards were misaligned when names were too long.
5. Global variables passed via URL query parameters in share links were not loaded in the frontend UI.
6. CSV file detection failed on Windows.
7. Models that were not started could not be tested during model testing.
8. MCP headers with special content caused errors.
9. When referencing another Agent in a workflow, the UI was not updated after switching versions.
10. HTTP node used null instead of empty string for global variables with empty string values.
11. Condition node connections broke when the node was collapsed.
12. Single-select and multi-select variable options were not displayed during node debugging.
13. Publish channel documentation links pointed to incorrect locations.
14. Checkbox hover style was incorrect in disabled state.
15. Default huggingface.svg icon displayed incorrectly when model avatar was missing.
16. Log export end date was off by one day.

18. max_tokens parameter was not passed during tool calls.
19. Workflow condition node value type was not determined by combining the condition with the value.
20. Knowledge base data not using direct chunking mode had incorrect citation reader navigation order. The citation reader only loaded the same page.
