--header 'rootkey: {{rootkey}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'

This will migrate all knowledge base files from MongoDB GridFS to S3, including text datasets and image datasets, but not images extracted from documents (e.g., .docx files).

## New Features

1. Knowledge base files migrated to S3 (all file-related functionality has been migrated).
2. Global variables now support file upload.
3. Form input node now supports password, toggle, time point, time range, file upload, and chat model selection.
4. Plugin input now supports multi-select, time point, time range, and internal variables.
5. System plugins in the Plugin Marketplace now show whether a new version is available, with an update button.
6. Workflow execution QPM (queries per minute) rate limiting.

## Improvements

1. Improved UX for file upload input in workflow tools.
2. Added permission table validation middleware to improve permission system robustness.

## Bug Fixes

1. Workflow debug preview window lost input values due to re-rendering.
2. When the S3 service shared the same origin as the main service, file request URLs to S3 were incorrectly rewritten, causing 404 errors.

## Plugin Updates

1. Updated tool versioning logic with a computed version value for update detection.
2. WeChat Official Account toolset: now allows uploading multiple documents to the draft box at once.
3. Fixed tool cache not being refreshed correctly.
4. Fixed static files being re-uploaded when refreshing cache in development mode.
5. Fixed images not being uploaded correctly after uploading a .pkg file.
