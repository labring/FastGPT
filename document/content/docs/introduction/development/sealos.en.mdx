## Deployment Architecture

![](/imgs/sealos-fastgpt.webp)

## Multi-Model Support

FastGPT uses the one-api project to manage model pools, supporting OpenAI, Azure, mainstream domestic models, and local models.

See: [Quick OneAPI Deployment on Sealos](/docs/introduction/development/modelconfig/one-api)

## One-Click Deployment

With Sealos, you don't need to purchase servers or domains. It supports high concurrency and dynamic scaling, and databases use KubeBlocks with far better I/O performance than simple Docker container deployments. Choose a region below based on your needs.

### Singapore Region

Singapore servers are overseas with direct access to OpenAI, but users in mainland China need a VPN. International pricing is slightly higher. Click below to deploy 👇

### Beijing Region

The Beijing region is hosted by Volcano Engine. Users in mainland China get stable access, but it can't reach OpenAI or other overseas services. Pricing is about 1/4 of the Singapore region. Click below to deploy 👇

### 1. Start Deployment

Since databases need to be deployed, wait 2–4 minutes after deployment before accessing. The default uses minimal resources, so the first access may be slow.

Follow the prompts to enter `root_password` and the `openai`/`oneapi` address and key.

After clicking deploy, you'll be redirected to the app management page. Click the details button on the right side of the `fastgpt` main app (named fastgpt-xxxx), as shown below.

![](/imgs/sealos-deploy1.jpg)

After clicking details, you'll see the FastGPT deployment management page. Click the link in the external access address to open the FastGPT service.

To bind a custom domain or modify deployment parameters, click **Change** in the top right and follow Sealos' instructions.

### 2. Log In

Username: `root`

Password: the `root_password` you set during one-click deployment

### 3. Configure Models

### 4. Configure Models

You must configure at least one model set, or the system won't work properly.

[View model configuration tutorial](./modelConfig/intro/)

## Pricing

Sealos uses pay-as-you-go billing based on allocated CPU, memory, and disk. For specific pricing, open the **Cost Center** in the Sealos control panel.

## Using Sealos

### Modifying Config Files and Environment Variables

In Sealos, open **App Launchpad** to see deployed FastGPT apps, and open **Database** to see corresponding databases.

In **App Launchpad**, select FastGPT, click **Change**, and you'll see environment variables and config files.

<Alert icon="🤖" context="success">
  On Sealos, FastGPT runs 1 service and 2 databases. When pausing or deleting, handle the databases together. (You can start them during the day and pause at night to save costs.)

### How to Update/Upgrade FastGPT

[Upgrade script documentation](./upgrading/) — read the docs first to determine which version to upgrade to. Do not skip versions.

For example, if you're on version 4.5 and want to upgrade to 4.5.1: change the image version to v4.5.1, run the upgrade script, wait for completion, then continue upgrading. If the target version doesn't require initialization, skip it.

Upgrade steps:

1. Check the [update documentation](./upgrading/index/) to confirm the target version — avoid skipping versions.
2. Open Sealos app management
3. There are 2 apps: fastgpt, fastgpt-pro
4. Click the 3 dots on the right side of the app, then **Change**. Or click details, then **Change** in the top right.
5. Modify the image version number

6. Click **Change/Restart** to automatically pull the latest image and update
7. Run the initialization script for the corresponding version (if applicable)

### How to Get the FastGPT Access Link

Open the corresponding app and click the external access address.

### Configure a Custom Domain

Click **Change** on the app -> **Custom Domain** -> enter domain -> configure domain CNAME -> confirm -> confirm change.

### How to Modify Config Files

Open Sealos app management -> find the app -> **Change** -> scroll down to advanced configuration where you'll find config files -> add new or click an existing config file to edit -> click confirm change in the top right.

### Modify Site Name and Favicon

Add these environment variables to the app:

```
SYSTEM_NAME=FastGPT
SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION=
SYSTEM_FAVICON=/favicon.ico
HOME_URL=/dashboard/agent
```

SYSTEM_FAVICON can be a URL.

### Mount a Logo

Currently, the browser logo can't be fully replaced — only SVG is supported. Full replacement will be available after visual customization is implemented.

Add a mounted file with path: `/app/projects/app/public/icon/logo.svg`, with the SVG content as the value.
