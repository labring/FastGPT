FastGPT can also integrate models through PPIO LLM API.

FastGPT is a platform that simplifies the entire AI development, deployment, and usage workflow into visual operations. It allows developers to skip deep algorithm research and users to avoid complex technical knowledge, making AI technology accessible through a one-stop service.

PPIO Cloud provides easy-to-use API interfaces that let developers easily call models like DeepSeek.

- **For developers:** No need to restructure your architecture — 3 interfaces cover everything from text generation to decision reasoning. Design AI workflows like building blocks.
- **For ecosystems:** Automatically adapts resource requirements from small apps to enterprise systems, letting intelligence grow naturally with your business.

The tutorial below provides a complete integration guide (including key configuration) to help you quickly connect FastGPT with PPIO API.

## 1. Prerequisites

(1) Get the API endpoint

Fixed URL: `https://api.ppinfra.com/v3/openai/chat/completions`

(2) Get your **API Key**

Log in to the PPIO Cloud console [API Key Management](https://www.ppinfra.com/settings/key-management) page and click the create button.
Register with invitation code **VOJL20** to get a ¥50 voucher.

(3) Generate and save your **API Key**

<Alert context="warning">
  Keys are encrypted on the server. Save your key when it's generated — if you lose it, you'll need to delete and create a new one in the console.

  alt="Save API Key"

(4) Get the model ID you want to use

DeepSeek series:

- DeepSeek R1: deepseek/deepseek-r1/community
- DeepSeek V3: deepseek/deepseek-v3/community

For other model IDs, max context, and pricing, see: [Model List](https://ppinfra.com/model-api/pricing)

## 2. Deploy the Latest FastGPT to Your Local Environment

<Alert context="warning">
  Use version v4.8.22 or later. Deployment guide: [Deploy FastGPT](/docs/introduction/development/intro/)
</Alert>

## 3. Model Configuration (Choose One Method)

**(1) Integrate PPIO Models via OneAPI**

Refer to the OneAPI documentation and update FastGPT's environment variables.

After generating a token in One API, FastGPT can request One API by modifying the baseurl and key, and One API will route to different models. Update these two environment variables:

```bash
# Must include v1. If on the same network, you can use an internal address.
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://OneAPI-IP:OneAPI-PORT/v1

# The key below is the token provided by One API
CHAT_API_KEY=sk-UyVQcpQWMU7ChTVl74B562C28e3c46Fe8f16E6D8AeF8736e
```

- After updating, restart FastGPT and select PPIO Cloud in the model provider settings as shown below:

  alt="Select PPIO Cloud"
/>

- **Test connectivity**
  Using DeepSeek as an example, select `deepseek/deepseek-r1/community` in the model list and click the test button (②) to test connectivity. A green success message confirms the connection is working and you can proceed with conversation configuration.

**(2) Integrate PPIO Models Without OneAPI**

Select PPIO Cloud in the model provider settings as shown below:

- **Configure the model**
  Enter the custom request URL: `https://api.ppinfra.com/v3/openai/chat/completions`
