title: Integrate SigNoz Service Monitoring
description: FastGPT integration with SigNoz service monitoring
---

## Overview

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an open-source Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and observability platform that provides comprehensive service monitoring for FastGPT. Built on the OpenTelemetry standard, it collects, processes, and visualizes telemetry data from distributed systems, including distributed tracing, metrics monitoring, and log analysis.

**Key Features:**

- **Distributed Tracing:** Track the complete call chain of user requests across FastGPT services
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor key metrics like API response times and throughput
- **Error Tracking:** Automatically capture and record system exceptions for troubleshooting
- **Log Aggregation:** Centrally collect and manage application logs with structured query support
- **Real-time Alerts:** Set alert rules based on metric thresholds to detect system anomalies early

## Deploy SigNoz

You can use [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) cloud service or self-host it. Here's how to quickly deploy SigNoz on Sealos.

1. Click the card below to deploy SigNoz with one click.

2. Enable external access for SigNoz

After deployment, click **Details** in P1 to go to the app details page, then click **Change** in the top right corner and enable the external address for port 4318 (skip this step if using internal network).

3. Get the SigNoz access address

After the change completes, wait for the public address to be ready, copy it, and enter it in FastGPT. If using internal network, you can directly copy the internal address for port 4318.

## Configure FastGPT

1. Update FastGPT environment variables

**Log level options**: `trace` | `debug` | `info` | `warning` | `error` | `fatal`

```dotenv
LOG_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true # Enable console logging
LOG_CONSOLE_LEVEL=debug # Minimum log level for console output
LOG_ENABLE_OTEL=true # Enable OTEL log collection
LOG_OTEL_LEVEL=info # Minimum log level for OTEL collection
LOG_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=fastgpt-client # Service name passed to the OTLP collector
LOG_OTEL_URL=http://localhost:4318/v1/logs # Your OTLP collector address — don't forget /v1/logs
```

2. Restart FastGPT

## Verify the Setup

Go back to the Sealos app management list, click into the SigNoz frontend project, and access its public address to open the dashboard.

First-time registration requires creating an account (data is stored in the local database) — fill in anything.

After logging in, if you see `logs` and `traces` lit up in the COMPLETED steps on the right, the configuration is successful.

## Notes

1. Adjust log retention period

SigNoz monitoring is very disk-intensive. First, don't store FastGPT debug logs in SigNoz. Also, consider setting the log retention period to 7 days. If SigNoz data stops growing and memory keeps increasing, the disk is full — you'll need to expand capacity.
