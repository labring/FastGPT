## Object Storage Configuration

This guide covers environment variable configuration for object storage providers supported by FastGPT, including self-hosted MinIO, AWS S3, Alibaba Cloud OSS, and Tencent Cloud COS.

### Common Required Environment Variables

> - Temporary credential authentication (e.g., STS) is not supported. Ensure service security on your own.
> - Private bucket reuse is not supported. If you set the private and public bucket names to the same value, ensure the bucket policy is at least **public read, private write**.

- `STORAGE_VENDOR` Enum value. Options: `minio`, `aws-s3`, `oss`, `cos`.
- `STORAGE_REGION` Region where the object storage service is located, e.g., `us-east-1`. Refer to your provider's region list. For self-hosted MinIO, any value works.
- `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` Access Key ID for the service credentials
- `STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` Secret Access Key for the service credentials
- `STORAGE_PUBLIC_BUCKET` FastGPT public resource bucket name
- `STORAGE_PRIVATE_BUCKET` FastGPT private resource bucket name

### Self-Hosted MinIO and AWS S3

> MinIO has strong AWS S3 protocol support, so MinIO and AWS S3 configurations are nearly identical — differences come from provider-specific or self-hosted requirements.
> In theory, any object storage with S3 protocol support comparable to MinIO will work, such as SeaweedFS, RustFS, etc.

- `STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT` Internal connection address. Can be a container ID, e.g., `http://fastgpt-minio:9000`
- `STORAGE_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT` An address accessible by both **server** and **client** to reach the bucket. Use a fixed host IP or domain name — don't use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` (containers can't access loopback addresses). This address is used when generating signed file upload URLs.
- `STORAGE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` [Optional] Virtual-hosted-style or path-style routing. If vendor is `minio`, this is fixed to `true`.
- `STORAGE_S3_MAX_RETRIES` [Optional] Maximum request retry attempts. Default: 3

**Complete Example**

> If using Sealos object storage, set `STORAGE_VENDOR` to `aws-s3`

```dotenv
STORAGE_VENDOR=minio
STORAGE_REGION=us-east-1
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
STORAGE_PUBLIC_BUCKET=fastgpt-public
STORAGE_PRIVATE_BUCKET=fastgpt-private
STORAGE_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9000
STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9000
STORAGE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
STORAGE_S3_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### Alibaba Cloud OSS

> - [CORS Configuration](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/oss/user-guide/configure-cross-origin-resource-sharing/?spm=5176.8466032.console-base_help.dexternal.1bcd1450Wau6J6#b58400ec36rqf)

- `STORAGE_OSS_ENDPOINT` Alibaba Cloud OSS hostname. Default is usually `{region}.aliyuncs.com`, e.g., `oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com`. If using a custom domain, enter it here, e.g., `your-domain.com`
- `STORAGE_OSS_CNAME` Whether custom domain is enabled
- `STORAGE_OSS_SECURE` Whether TLS is enabled. Disable if your domain doesn't have a certificate.
- `STORAGE_OSS_INTERNAL` [Optional] Whether to use internal network access. Enable if your service is also on Alibaba Cloud to save bandwidth. Default: disabled

**Complete Example**

```dotenv
STORAGE_VENDOR=oss
STORAGE_REGION=oss-cn-hangzhou
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
STORAGE_PUBLIC_BUCKET=fastgpt-public
STORAGE_PRIVATE_BUCKET=fastgpt-private
STORAGE_OSS_ENDPOINT=oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com
STORAGE_OSS_CNAME=false
STORAGE_OSS_SECURE=false
STORAGE_OSS_INTERNAL=false
```

### Tencent Cloud COS

> - [CORS Configuration](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13318)

- `STORAGE_COS_PROTOCOL` Options: `https:`, `http:` — don't forget the `:`. If your custom domain doesn't have a certificate, don't use `https:`
- `STORAGE_COS_USE_ACCELERATE` [Optional] Enable global acceleration domain. Default: false. If true, the bucket must have global acceleration enabled.
- `STORAGE_COS_CNAME_DOMAIN` [Optional] Custom domain, e.g., `your-domain.com`
- `STORAGE_COS_PROXY` [Optional] Proxy server, e.g., `http://localhost:7897`

**Complete Example**

```dotenv
STORAGE_VENDOR=cos
STORAGE_REGION=ap-shanghai
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
STORAGE_PUBLIC_BUCKET=fastgpt-public
STORAGE_PRIVATE_BUCKET=fastgpt-private
STORAGE_COS_PROTOCOL=http:
STORAGE_COS_USE_ACCELERATE=false
STORAGE_COS_CNAME_DOMAIN=
STORAGE_COS_PROXY=
```
