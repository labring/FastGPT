This guide covers how to set up your development environment to build and test <FastGPTLink>FastGPT</FastGPTLink>.

## Prerequisites

Install and configure these dependencies on your computer to build <FastGPTLink>FastGPT</FastGPTLink>:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node.js v20.14.0](https://nodejs.org) (match this version if possible; use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) recommended version 9.4.0 (current official dev environment)

We recommend developing on *nix environments (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL).

## Start Local Development

### 1. Fork the FastGPT Repository

Fork the [FastGPT repository](https://github.com/labring/FastGPT).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone your forked repository from GitHub:

```
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/FastGPT.git
```

### 3. Start the Development Environment with Docker

If you're already running FastGPT locally via Docker, stop it first to avoid port conflicts.

Switch to the `FastGPT/deploy/dev` directory and run `docker compose up -d` to start FastGPT's dependencies:

```bash
cd FastGPT/deploy/dev
docker compose up -d
```

<Alert context="warning">
    1. If you can't pull images, use the China mirror version: `docker compose -f docker-compose.cn.yml up -d`
    2. For MongoDB, add the `directConnection=true` parameter to your connection string to connect to the replica set.
</Alert>

### 4. Initial Configuration

All files below are in the `projects/app` directory.

```bash
# Make sure you're in projects/app
pwd
# Should output /xxxx/xxxx/xxx/FastGPT/projects/app
```

**1. Environment Variables**

Copy `.env.template` to create `.env.local` in the same directory. Only changes in `.env.local` take effect.
See `.env.template` for variable descriptions.
If you haven't modified variables in docker-compose.yaml, the defaults in `.env.template` work fine. Otherwise, match the values in your `yml` file.

```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
```

**2. config.json Configuration File**

Copy `data/config.json` to create `data/config.local.json`. For detailed configuration parameters, see [config documentation](/docs/introduction/development/configuration).

```bash
cp data/config.json data/config.local.json
```

You usually don't need to modify this file. Just pay attention to these `systemEnv` parameters:

- `vectorMaxProcess`: Max vector generation processes. Depends on database and key concurrency. For a single 120-core, 2c4g server, set to 10~15.
- `qaMaxProcess`: Max QA generation processes
- `vlmMaxProcess`: Max image understanding model processes
- `hnswEfSearch`: Vector search parameter (PG and OB only). Higher values = better accuracy but slower speed.

### 5. Run

Refer to `dev.md` in the project root. The first compile and run may take a while—be patient!

```bash
# Run from the code root directory to install all dependencies in root package, projects, and packages
# If isolate-vm installation fails, see: https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements
pwd # Should be in the code root directory
pnpm i
cd projects/app
pnpm dev
```

Next.js will run on port 3000 by default. Visit http://localhost:3000

### 6. Build

We recommend using Docker for builds.

```bash
# Without proxy
docker build -f ./projects/app/Dockerfile -t fastgpt . --build-arg name=app
# With Taobao proxy
docker build -f ./projects/app/Dockerfile -t fastgpt . --build-arg name=app --build-arg proxy=taobao
```

If you don't use Docker, you'll need to manually execute all the run stage commands from the `Dockerfile` (not recommended).

## Submit Code to the Open Source Repository

1. Make sure your code is forked from the [FastGPT](https://github.com/labring/FastGPT) repository
2. Submit small, focused changes—each commit should solve one problem
3. Submit a PR to FastGPT's main branch. After submission, the FastGPT team and community will review it with you.

If you run into issues like merge conflicts or don't know how to open a pull request, check out GitHub's [pull request tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) to learn how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues. Once your PR is merged, you'll proudly appear in the [contributors table](https://github.com/labring/FastGPT/graphs/contributors).

## QA

### System Time Exception

If your default timezone is `Asia/Shanghai`, getting system time may fail in non-Linux environments. For local development, change your timezone to UTC (+0).

### Can't Connect to Local Database

1. If connecting to a remote database, check if the port is open.
2. For local databases, try changing `host` to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
3. For local connections to remote MongoDB, add the `directConnection=true` parameter to connect to replica sets.
4. Use `mongocompass` client for MongoDB connection testing and visual management.
5. Use `navicat` for PostgreSQL connection and management.

### sh ./scripts/postinstall.sh Permission Denied

FastGPT runs a `postinstall` script after `pnpm i` to auto-generate `ChakraUI` types. If you get a permission error, run `chmod -R +x ./scripts/` first, then `pnpm i`.

If that doesn't work, manually execute the contents of `./scripts/postinstall.sh`.
_On Windows, use git bash to add execute permissions and run the sh script._

### TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useMemo')

Delete all `node_modules` and reinstall with Node 18—the latest Node version may have issues. Local dev workflow:

1. Root directory: `pnpm i`
2. Copy `config.json` -> `config.local.json`
3. Copy `.env.template` -> `.env.local`
4. `cd projects/app`
5. `pnpm dev`

### Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path 'XXX': mkdir XXX: file exists

This error may be caused by leftover files from a previous container stop. First, make sure all related images are stopped, then manually delete the files or restart Docker.

## Code Structure

### Next.js

FastGPT uses Next.js page routing as its framework. To separate frontend and backend code, directories are split into global, service, and web subdirectories for `shared`, `backend-only`, and `frontend-only` code respectively.

### Monorepo

FastGPT uses pnpm workspace to build a monorepo project with two main parts:

- projects/app - FastGPT main project
- packages/ - Submodules
  - global - Shared code, usually functions, type declarations, and constants that work on both frontend and backend
  - service - Server-side code
  - web - Frontend code
  - plugin - Custom workflow plugin code

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

FastGPT's code modules follow DDD principles, divided into these domains:

- core - Core features (knowledge base, workflow, app, conversation)
- support - Supporting features (user system, billing, authentication, etc.)
- common - Basic features (log management, file I/O, etc.)
