title: Docker Database Migration (Simple Method)
description: FastGPT Docker database backup and migration

## 1. Stop Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```


## 2. Copy Directories

Docker-deployed databases mount local directories into containers via volumes. To migrate, simply copy these directories.

`PG data`: pg/data
`Mongo data`: mongo/data

Just copy the entire pg and mongo directories to the new location.
