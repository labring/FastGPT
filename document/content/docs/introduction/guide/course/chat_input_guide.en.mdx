## What is Custom Question Guidance?

You can preset questions for your app. As users type, the system dynamically searches these questions based on their input and displays them as suggestions, helping users ask questions faster.

You can configure the question list directly in FastGPT or provide a custom API endpoint.

## Custom Question List API

The endpoint must be accessible from the user's browser.

**Request:**

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/core/chat/inputGuide/query?appId=663c75302caf8315b1c00194&searchKey=you'
```

Where `appId` is the application ID and `searchKey` is the search keyword (max 50 characters).

**Response**

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "statusText": "",
  "message": "",
  "data": [
    "it's you",
    "who are you",
    "you're great",
    "hello there",
    "who are you!",
    "hello"
  ]
}
```

`data` is an array of matched questions. Return at most 5 results.


**Parameters:**

- appId - Application ID
- searchKey - Search keyword
