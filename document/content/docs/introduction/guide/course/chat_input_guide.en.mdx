## What are Custom Input Suggestions?

You can preset questions for your app. As users type, the system dynamically searches these questions based on their input and suggests them as prompts, helping users ask questions faster.

You can configure the question library directly in FastGPT or provide a custom API endpoint.

## Custom Question Library API

The endpoint must be accessible from the user's browser.

**Request:**

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/core/chat/inputGuide/query?appId=663c75302caf8315b1c00194&searchKey=你'
```

Where `appId` is the application ID and `searchKey` is the search keyword (max 50 characters).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "statusText": "",
  "message": "",
  "data": [
    "是你",
    "你是谁呀",
    "你好好呀",
    "你好呀",
    "你是谁!",
    "你好"
  ]
}
```

The data array contains matching questions. Return up to 5 questions.

**Parameters:**

- appId - Application ID
- searchKey - Search keyword
