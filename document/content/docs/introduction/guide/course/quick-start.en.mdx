## Knowledge Base

Before you begin, prepare a test document — Word, PDF, TXT, Excel, or Markdown all work. For example, a company leave policy, non-confidential sales scripts, or product documentation.

We'll use the FastGPT Chinese README file as an example.

First, create a Knowledge Base.

After creating the Knowledge Base, upload some content.

There are four upload modes:
- Manual Input: Enter QA pairs manually — the most precise method
- QA Split: Upload a text file and let AI generate QA pairs automatically
- Direct Chunking: Upload a text file and split it into segments directly
- CSV Import: Batch import QA pairs

Here we'll use QA Split to let AI generate QA pairs automatically. You can edit them manually later if the quality isn't satisfactory.

After uploading, wait for processing to complete until the file status shows as available.
