## Knowledge Base

Before you begin, prepare a test document — Word, PDF, TXT, Excel, or Markdown files all work. Think company policies, sales scripts, product documentation, or anything non-confidential.

For this example, we'll use FastGPT's Chinese README file.

First, create a knowledge base.

Once created, you'll need to add some content.

There are four ways to upload content:
- Manual Input: Enter Q&A pairs manually for the most accurate data
- QA Split: Upload a text file and let AI automatically generate Q&A pairs
- Direct Segmentation: Upload a text file and split it into chunks automatically
- CSV Import: Bulk import Q&A pairs

Here, we'll choose QA Split to let AI generate questions and answers automatically. If the quality isn't great, you can always edit them manually later.

After uploading, wait for the data to process. Your file status will change to "Available" when ready.

## Application

Click the "Application" button to create a new app. You'll see four templates — choose "Knowledge Base + Conversation Guide."

Once created, go to the app details page and find the "Knowledge Base" module. Add the knowledge base you just created.

After adding the knowledge base, remember to click "Save and Preview" to link your app with the knowledge base.
