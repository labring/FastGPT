description: A quick guide to integrating MCP tools with FastGPT

Starting from FastGPT v4.9.6, a new application type called MCP Tools has been added. It lets you provide an MCP SSE URL to batch-create tools that models can easily call. Here's how to create MCP tools and have AI use them.

## Create an MCP Tools Collection

First, select "New MCP Tools Collection." We'll use the Amap (Gaode Maps) MCP Server as an example: [Amap MCP Server](https://lbs.amap.com/api/mcp-server/create-project-and-key)

You'll need an MCP URL, e.g., https://mcp.amap.com/sse?key=xxx

Enter the URL in the dialog and click Parse. The system will discover and list the available tools.

Click Create to finish setting up the MCP tools and collection.

## Test MCP Tools

Inside the MCP Tools collection, you can debug each tool individually.

For example, select the maps_weather tool and click Run to see the weather data for Hangzhou.


## AI Calling Tools

### Call Individual Tools

Using maps_weather and maps_text_search as examples, ask the AI two different questions. The AI intelligently selects the appropriate tool, retrieves the needed information, and responds based on the results.

### Call an Entire Tools Collection

FastGPT also supports calling an entire MCP Tools collection. The AI automatically picks the right tool to execute.

Click the MCP Tools collection to add a collection-type node, then connect it using the Tool Calling node.

The AI similarly selects the appropriate tool, retrieves the needed information, and responds based on the results.
