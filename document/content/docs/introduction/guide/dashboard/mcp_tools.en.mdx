Starting from FastGPT v4.9.6, a new application type called MCP Tools has been added. It allows you to input an MCP SSE URL to batch create MCP tools that models can easily call. Let's see how to create MCP tools and have AI call them.

## Create an MCP Tools Collection

First, select to create a new MCP Tools collection. Using Amap (Gaode Maps) MCP Server as an example, [Amap MCP Server](https://lbs.amap.com/api/mcp-server/create-project-and-key)

You need to obtain an MCP address, e.g., https://mcp.amap.com/sse?key=xxx

Then fill it into the corresponding position in the popup and click parse. It will parse out a series of corresponding tools.

Click create to easily create MCP tools and MCP tools collection.

## Test MCP Tools

Enter the MCP tools collection to debug each individual MCP tool.

Taking maps_weather (weather query tool) as an example, click run to see the specific weather for Hangzhou.

## Model Calling Tools

### Call Individual Tools

Using maps_weather and maps_text_search as examples, ask AI two questions. You can see AI intelligently calls the corresponding tools to get needed information, then answers based on that information.

### Call Tools Collection

FastGPT also supports calling entire MCP tools collections. AI automatically selects needed tools to execute.

Click MCP tools collection to add a tools collection type node, connected using the tool calling node.

You can see AI similarly intelligently calls corresponding tools, gets needed information, then answers based on that information.
