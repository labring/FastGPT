## What It Does

The Form Input node is a user interaction node. When triggered, the conversation enters an "interactive" state -- the workflow state is saved and execution pauses until the user completes the interaction.

In the example above, when the Form Input node is triggered, the chat box is hidden and the conversation enters interactive mode.
