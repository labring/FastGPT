## Use Cases

Merges multiple knowledge base search results into a single output, re-ranks them using RRF (based on ranking), and supports max tokens filtering.

## Usage

AI Chat can only receive one knowledge base reference. Therefore, if multiple knowledge bases are called, you can't directly reference all of them (as shown below).

Using **Knowledge Base Search Merge**, you can combine search results from multiple knowledge bases.

## Example Use Cases:

1. After question classification, search different knowledge bases, then have a single AI answer. In this case, you can use merge instead of adding an AI Chat node to each branch.
