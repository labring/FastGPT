## What It Does

Merges search results from multiple Knowledge Bases into a single output, re-ranks them using RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion), and supports max token filtering.

## Usage

The AI Chat node can only accept one Knowledge Base reference input. If you call multiple Knowledge Bases, you cannot directly reference all of them (as shown below).

Use **Knowledge Base Search Merge** to combine results from multiple Knowledge Bases into one.

## Example Use Cases

1. After question classification, search different Knowledge Bases per category, then feed the merged results to a single AI Chat node. This avoids adding a separate AI Chat node to each branch.
