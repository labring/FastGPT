## Overview

The Custom Feedback node adds a feedback tag to conversations, making it easier to analyze conversation data from the admin panel.

In debug mode, feedback content is not recorded. Instead it displays: `Auto feedback test: feedback content`.

In conversation mode (chat, shared window, or API calls with chatId), feedback content is recorded in the conversation log with a 60-second delay.

## Use Cases

The Custom Feedback node works like event tracking in software development, letting you observe and monitor data within conversations.
