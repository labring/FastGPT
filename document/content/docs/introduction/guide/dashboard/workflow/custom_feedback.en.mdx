## Introduction

The custom feedback module adds a feedback marker to your conversations, making it easier to analyze conversation data in the backend.

In debug mode, feedback content isn't recorded. Instead, it displays: `Auto feedback test: feedback content`.

In conversation mode (chat, share window, API calls with chatId), feedback content is recorded in conversation logs (with a 60s delay).

## Use Cases

The custom feedback module functions like "event tracking" in software development, helping you observe conversation data.
