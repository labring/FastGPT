## Function

Classifies user questions and executes different operations based on the classification. In more ambiguous scenarios, classification effectiveness may be less obvious.

## Parameters

### System Prompt

Placed at the beginning of the conversation to supplement classification definitions. For example, questions might be classified as:

1. Greetings
2. Laf FAQs
3. Other questions

Since Laf isn't immediately clear, you need to define it. The prompt can include Laf's definition:

```
Laf is a cloud development platform for rapid application development
Laf is an open-source BaaS development platform (Backend as a Service)
Laf is a ready-to-use serverless development platform
Laf is an all-in-one development platform combining "function computing," "database," "object storage," and more
Laf can be thought of as an open-source Tencent Cloud Development, open-source Google Firebase, or open-source UniCloud
```

### Chat History

Adding some chat history helps with context-aware classification.

### User Question

The user's input content.

### Classification Content

Using the same 3 classifications as an example, you can see the final Function composition. The return value is randomly generated by the system and doesn't need attention.

1. Greetings
2. Laf FAQs
3. Other questions

```js
const agentFunction = {
    name: agentFunName,
    description: 'Determine which category the user question belongs to and return the corresponding enum field',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        type: {
          type: 'string',
          description: `Greetings, return: abc; Laf FAQs, return: vvv; Other questions, return: aaa`
          enum: ["abc","vvv","aaa"]
        }
      },
      required: ['type']
    }
};
```

The above Function will always return one of `type = abc, vvv, aaa`, achieving classification.
