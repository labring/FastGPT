## Function

The "User Selection" node is an interactive node. When triggered, the conversation enters an "interactive" state -- the workflow state is saved and execution pauses until the user completes the interaction.

In the example above, when the User Selection node triggers, the chat input is hidden and the conversation enters interactive mode.

When the user makes a choice, the node evaluates the selection and executes the corresponding branch (e.g., the "Yes" branch).

## Use Cases

The basic pattern is to present a question that requires a user decision, then route to different workflow paths based on the user's response.
