## Function

The "User Selection" node is a user interaction node. When this node is triggered, the conversation enters an "interactive" state, recording the workflow state and continuing execution after the user completes the interaction.

In the example above, when the user selection node is triggered, the chat box is hidden and the conversation enters "interactive state."

When the user makes a selection, the node evaluates the user's choice and executes the "Yes" branch.

## Use Cases
