## Function

Performs an `IF` evaluation on any variable. If the condition is met, the `IF` branch executes; otherwise the `ELSE` branch runs.

In the example above, if the "Knowledge Base Citation" variable has a length of 0, the `IF` branch executes; otherwise the `ELSE` branch runs.

You can add more conditions and branches, following the same logic as `IF` statements in programming languages.

## Use Cases

Common scenarios include: having the LLM make a judgment and then output fixed content, or checking the LLM's response to decide whether to trigger downstream modules.
