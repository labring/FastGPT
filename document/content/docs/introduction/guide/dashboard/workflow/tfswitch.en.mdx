## Function

Performs `IF` judgment on any variable. If the condition is met, executes the `IF` branch; otherwise executes the `ELSE` branch.

In the example above, if the length of the "Knowledge Base Reference" variable equals 0, the `IF` branch executes; otherwise the `ELSE` branch executes.

Supports adding more conditions and branches, following the same logic as `IF` statements in programming languages.

## Use Cases

Suitable scenarios include: having the LLM make a judgment then output fixed content, or determining whether to trigger subsequent modules based on LLM response content.
