description: 'A quick overview of FastGPT app evaluation'

Starting from FastGPT v4.11.0, batch app evaluation is supported. By providing multiple QA pairs, the system automatically scores your app's responses, enabling quantitative assessment of app performance.

The system supports three evaluation metrics: answer accuracy, question relevance, and semantic accuracy. The current beta only includes answer accuracy — the remaining metrics will be added in future releases.
