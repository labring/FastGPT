FastGPT Cloud supports custom domains starting from v4.14.4.

## How to Configure a Custom Domain

### 1. Open the "Custom Domain" Page

In the sidebar, select "Account" -> "Custom Domain" to open the configuration page.

If your plan doesn't support this feature, follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade.

### 2. Add Your Custom Domain

1. Prepare your domain. Your domain must be registered with one of these providers: Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, or Volcano Engine.
2. Click the "Edit" button to enter edit mode.
3. Enter your domain, for example: www.example.com
4. In your domain provider's DNS settings, add the CNAME record shown on the screen.
5. After adding the DNS record, click "Save". The system will automatically verify the DNS configuration. This usually takes less than a minute. If it takes longer, try again.
6. Once the status shows "Active", click "Confirm" to finish.

You can now access FastGPT services and call FastGPT APIs using your own domain.

## DNS Resolution Failure

The system checks DNS resolution daily. If the DNS record becomes invalid, your custom domain will be disabled. You can re-verify it by clicking "Edit" in the "Custom Domain" management page.

To change your custom domain or switch providers, delete the existing configuration and set it up again.
