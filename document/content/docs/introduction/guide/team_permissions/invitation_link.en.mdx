Starting from v4.9.1, team member invitations use **invitation links** instead of the previous username-based method.

After upgrading, any pending invitations sent before the update will be automatically cleared. Please use invitation links to re-invite members.

## How to Use

1. **On the team management page, admins can click the "Invite Members" button to open the invitation dialog**

4. **Copy the link and send it to the people you want to invite**

5. **When users visit the link, they'll be redirected to the login page if not already logged in. After logging in, they'll see the team invitation page**

Click "Accept" to join the team

Click "Ignore" to close the dialog. The user can still accept the invitation by visiting the link again later.

## Link Expiration and Auto-Cleanup

### Why Links Expire

Link reaches its expiration date

Single-use link (1 person limit) has been used

Expired links cannot be accessed or re-enabled.

### Link Limits

Each user can have up to 10 **active** invitation links at a time.

### Auto-Cleanup

Expired links are automatically deleted after 30 days.
