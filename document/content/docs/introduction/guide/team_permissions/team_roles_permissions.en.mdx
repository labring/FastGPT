# Teams, Groups & Permissions

## Permission System Overview

FastGPT's permission system combines **attribute-based** and **role-based** access control, providing fine-grained permission management for team collaboration. Through **members, departments, and groups**, you can flexibly configure access to teams, apps, and knowledge bases.

## Teams

Each user can belong to multiple teams. The system automatically creates an initial team for every user. Manual creation of additional teams is not currently supported.

## Permission Management

FastGPT offers three permission management levels:

**Member Permissions**: Highest priority, directly assigned to individuals

**Department & Group Permissions**: Use union logic, lower priority than member permissions

Permission evaluation follows this logic:

First, check the user's individual member permissions

Then, check permissions from the user's departments and groups (union)

Final permissions are the combination of the above

Authorization logic:

### Resource Permissions

Different **resources** have different permissions.

Resources refer to concepts like apps, knowledge bases, teams, etc.

The table below shows the manageable permissions for different resources.

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Resource</th>
        <th>Manageable Permissions</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td rowSpan="4">Team</td>
        <td>Create Apps</td>
        <td>Create, delete, and other basic operations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Create Knowledge Bases</td>
        <td>Create, delete, and other basic operations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Create Team APIKey</td>
        <td>Create, delete, and other basic operations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Manage Members</td>
        <td>Invite/remove users, create groups, etc.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowSpan="3">App</td>
        <td>Can Use</td>
        <td>Allows conversation interaction</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Can Edit</td>
        <td>Modify basic info, workflow orchestration, etc.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Can Manage</td>
        <td>Add or remove collaborators</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowSpan="3">Knowledge Base</td>
        <td>Can Use</td>
        <td>Can call this knowledge base in apps</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Can Edit</td>
        <td>Modify knowledge base content</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Can Manage</td>
        <td>Add or remove collaborators</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### Collaborators

You must add **collaborators** before managing their permissions:

When managing team permissions, first select members/organizations/groups, then configure permissions.

For resources like apps and knowledge bases, you can directly modify member permissions.

Team permissions are set on a dedicated permissions page.

## Special Permissions

### Admin Permissions

Admins primarily manage resource collaboration relationships, with these limitations:

- Cannot modify or remove their own permissions
- Cannot modify or remove other admins' permissions
- Cannot grant admin permissions to other collaborators

### Owner Permissions

Each resource has a unique Owner with the highest permissions for that resource. Owners can transfer ownership, but will lose all permissions to the resource after transfer.

### Root Permissions

Root is the system's only super admin account, with complete access and management rights to all resources across all teams.

## Tips

### 1. Set Default Team Permissions

Use the "All Members Group" to quickly set baseline permissions for the entire team. For example, grant everyone access to an app.

**Note**: Individual member permissions override all-member group permissions. For example, if App A has all-member edit permissions, but User M is individually set to use-only, User M can only use the app, not edit it.

### 2. Batch Permission Management

Create groups or organizations to efficiently manage permissions for multiple users. Add users to a group, then grant permissions to the entire group.

#### Permission Design Principles

FastGPT's permission system is inspired by Linux permissions, using binary storage for permission bits. A permission bit of 1 means the permission is granted, 0 means no permission. Owner permissions are specially marked as all 1s.

#### Permission Table

Permission information is stored in MongoDB's resource_permissions collection, with these main fields:

- teamId: Team identifier
- tmbId/groupId/orgId: Permission subject (one of three)
- resourceType: Resource type (team/app/dataset)
- permission: Permission value (number)
- resourceId: Resource ID (null for team resources)

The system implements flexible and precise permission control through this data structure.

The schema for this table is defined in packages/service/support/permission/schema.ts:

```typescript
export const ResourcePermissionSchema = new Schema({
  teamId: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: TeamCollectionName
  },
  tmbId: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: TeamMemberCollectionName
  },
  groupId: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: MemberGroupCollectionName
  },
  orgId: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: OrgCollectionName
  },
  resourceType: {
    type: String,
    enum: Object.values(PerResourceTypeEnum),
    required: true
  },
  permission: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  // Resrouce ID: App or DataSet or any other resource type.
  // It is null if the resourceType is team.
  resourceId: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId
  }
});
```
