Starting from FastGPT v4.8.16, commercial version users support Yuque file library import. Users can import Yuque document libraries by configuring Yuque's token and uid. Currently in testing phase, some interactions need optimization.

## 1. Get Yuque token and uid

On Yuque homepage - Personal avatar - Settings, you can find the corresponding parameters.

## 3. Import Documents

After creating the knowledge base, click `Add File` to import Yuque's document library. Follow the guidance.

Yuque knowledge base supports scheduled sync function. It scans once daily at irregular times. If documents are updated, they will be synced. Manual sync is also available.
