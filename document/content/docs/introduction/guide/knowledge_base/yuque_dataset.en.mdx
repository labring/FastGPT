Starting from FastGPT v4.8.16, commercial edition users can import from Yuque file libraries by configuring a Yuque token and uid. This feature is currently in beta — some interactions may still need refinement.

## 1. Get the Yuque Token and UID

Go to the Yuque homepage > click your avatar > Settings to find the relevant parameters.

Follow the images below to get the Token and User ID. Make sure to assign the appropriate permissions to the Token:

## 2. Create the Knowledge Base

Using the token and uid from the previous step, create a knowledge base. Select the Yuque file library type, fill in the parameters, and click Create.

## 3. Import Documents

After creating the knowledge base, click `Add File` to import from your Yuque document library and follow the on-screen guidance.

The Yuque knowledge base supports scheduled sync — it scans once daily at varying times. If documents have been updated, they will be synced automatically. You can also trigger a manual sync.
