This feature is currently only available to commercial version users.

## What is Web Site Sync

Web site sync uses crawler technology to automatically capture all websites under the `same domain` through an entry website, currently supporting up to `200` sub-pages. For compliance and security reasons, FastGPT only supports crawling `static sites`, mainly for quickly building knowledge bases from various documentation sites.

Tips: Most Chinese media sites are not usable, including WeChat Official Accounts, CSDN, Zhihu, etc. You can check if it's a static site by sending a `curl` request from terminal, for example:

```bash
curl https://doc.fastgpt.io/docs/intro/
```

## How to Use

### 1. Create new knowledge base, select Web Site Sync

## How to Use Selectors

Selectors are a product of HTML CSS JS. You can use selectors to locate specific content you need to crawl, rather than the entire site. Usage:

### First open browser debug panel (usually F12, or [Right-click - Inspect])

### Enter corresponding element selector

[Runoob CSS Selectors Tutorial](https://www.runoob.com/cssref/css-selectors.html), refer to Runoob tutorial for specific selector usage.

In the image above, we selected an area corresponding to a `div` tag with three attributes: `data-prismjs-copy`, `data-prismjs-copy-success`, `data-prismjs-copy-error`. Using one is enough. So the selector is:
**`div[data-prismjs-copy]`**

Besides attribute selectors, class and ID selectors are also common. For example:

The class in the image above contains class names (may include multiple class names separated by spaces, choose one). The selector can be: **`.docs-content`**

### Using Multiple Selectors

In the opening demonstration, we used multiple selectors for FastGPT documentation, separated by commas.

We want to select content in the two tags above, requiring two selector groups. One is: `.docs-content .mb-0.d-flex`, meaning child elements under `docs-content` class that simultaneously contain both `mb-0` and `d-flex` classes;

The other is `.docs-content div[data-prismjs-copy]`, meaning `div` elements under `docs-content` class containing the `data-prismjs-copy` attribute.

Separate the two selector groups with a comma: `.docs-content .mb-0.d-flex, .docs-content div[data-prismjs-copy]`
