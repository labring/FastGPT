description: How to use collection tags in FastGPT Knowledge Base
---

Collection tags are a commercial-edition feature in FastGPT. They let you tag and categorize data collections within a knowledge base for more efficient data management.

You can also use tags as collection filters during knowledge base searches for more precise results.

## Basic Tag Operations

On the knowledge base detail page, you can manage tags with the following operations:

- Create a tag
- Rename a tag
- Delete a tag
- Assign a tag to multiple collections
- Add multiple tags to a single collection

You can also filter collections by tags.

## Collection Filtering in Knowledge Base Search

Tags can be used to filter collections during knowledge base searches by filling in the "Collection Filter" field. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "$and": ["Tag 1","Tag 2"],
    "$or": ["When $and tags are present, $and takes effect and $or is ignored"]
  },
  "createTime": {
      "$gte": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format, matches collections created after this time",
      "$lte": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format, matches collections created before this time. Can be used together with $gte"
  }
}
```

Two important notes:

- Tag values can be a `string` tag name or `null`, where `null` represents collections with no tags assigned
- There are two filter condition types: `$and` and `$or`. When both are set, only `$and` takes effect
