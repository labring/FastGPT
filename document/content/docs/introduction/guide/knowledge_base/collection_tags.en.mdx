Knowledge base collection tags are a FastGPT commercial version exclusive feature. They allow you to add tags to data collections in your knowledge base for classification, managing knowledge base data more efficiently.

Furthermore, you can add collection filtering when searching the knowledge base during Q&A, achieving more precise searches.

## Tag Basic Operations

On the knowledge base details page, you can manage tags with these operations:

- Create tags
- Modify tag names
- Delete tags
- Assign one tag to multiple data collections
- Add multiple tags to one data collection

You can also use tags to filter data collections

## Knowledge Base Search - Collection Filtering

Using tags, you can achieve more precise searches when searching the knowledge base by filling in the "Collection Filter" field. Specific filling examples are as follows:

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "$and": ["Tag 1","Tag 2"],
    "$or": ["When $and tags exist, and takes effect, or doesn't"]
  },
  "createTime": {
      "$gte": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format, collection creation time greater than this time",
      "$lte": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format, collection creation time less than this time, can be used together with $gte"
  }
}
```

Two points to note when filling:

- Tag values can be `string` type tag names or `null`, where `null` represents data collections without tags set
- Tag filtering has two condition types: `$and` and `$or`. When both `$and` and `$or` are set, only `$and` takes effect
