Starting from FastGPT v4.8.16, commercial edition users can import from Lark knowledge bases. Configure a Lark app's appId and appSecret, then select a **top-level folder in a document space** to import. This feature is currently in beta — some interactions may still need refinement.

Due to Lark API limitations, you cannot directly access all document content. Currently, only files in shared space directories are accessible — personal spaces and wiki content are not supported.

Only cloud document types are supported for import.


## 1. Create a Lark App

Go to the [Lark Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/?lang=zh-CN), click **Create App**, select **Custom App**, and fill in the app name.

## 2. Configure App Permissions

After creating the app, configure the following **3 permissions**:

1. View the list of cloud documents in a folder
2. View new-format documents
3. View, comment, edit, and manage all files in the cloud space

## 3. Get the appId and appSecret

## 4. Grant Folder Permissions

Refer to the Lark tutorial: https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/drive-v1/faq#b02e5bfb

In summary:

1. Add the app you just created to a group chat
2. Grant directory permissions to that group

If your directory already has permissions granted to the "All Members" group, you can skip the steps above and go directly to getting the Folder Token.

## 5. Get the Folder Token

You can find the Folder Token in the page URL. Make sure not to include the question mark.

## 6. Create the Knowledge Base

Using the 3 parameters obtained from steps 3 and 5, create a knowledge base. Select the Lark file library type, fill in the parameters, and click Create.
