Starting from FastGPT v4.8.16, commercial version users support Feishu knowledge base import. Users can import Feishu knowledge bases by configuring the Feishu app's appId and appSecret, and selecting a **top-level folder in a document space**. Currently in testing phase, some interactions need optimization.

Due to Feishu limitations, all document content cannot be directly obtained. Currently, only content from file directories under shared spaces can be obtained, not from personal spaces and knowledge bases.

Currently only supports importing cloud document type content.

## 1. Create Feishu Application

Open [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/?lang=zh-CN), click **Create Application**, select **Self-built Application**, then fill in the application name.

## 2. Configure Application Permissions

After creating the application, enter the application to configure related permissions. You need to add **3 permissions**:

1. Get cloud document list under cloud space folder
2. View new version documents
3. View, comment, edit, and manage all files in cloud space

## 4. Add Permissions to Folder

Refer to Feishu tutorial: https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/drive-v1/faq#b02e5bfb

Roughly summarized as:

1. Pull the just-created application into a group
2. Add directory permissions to this group

If your directory already has permissions added for all members group, you can skip the above steps and directly get the Folder Token.

## 5. Get Folder Token

You can get the Folder Token from the page path. Be careful not to copy the question mark.
