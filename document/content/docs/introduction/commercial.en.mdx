<Alert icon="🤖" context="success">
  - "6 versions of upgrade support" means the FastGPT team assists with 6 upgrades — not that the software stops working after 6 versions. Most upgrades are straightforward enough to handle yourself.
  - Fully managed is ideal for teams without dedicated ops staff — just focus on your business.
  - Self-hosted gives you full control with deployment on your own servers.
  - Single-node is suitable for small to mid-sized teams providing internal services; you'll manage database backups yourself.
  - High-availability is designed for public-facing services, including visual monitoring, replicas, load balancing, and automated database backups.

## Technical Support

### App Customization

We can build custom workflow orchestrations tailored to your needs, delivered as a complete app configuration. Pricing is negotiable based on scope.

### Technical Services (Custom Development, Maintenance, Migration, Third-party Integration)

¥2,000 – ¥3,000 per person per day

### Upgrade Fees

Most upgrades just require pulling the new image and running the initialization script — no extra steps needed.

For cross-version or complex upgrades, follow the documentation to upgrade yourself, or pay for support at the standard technical service rate.

## FAQ

### How is delivery handled?

Full application = Community Edition image + Commercial Edition image

We provide a Commercial Edition image that requires a License to start.

### How does custom development work?

You can modify the Community Edition source code, but the Commercial Edition image cannot be modified. Since the full version = Community Edition + Commercial Edition image, you can customize part of the codebase. However, if you fork the code, you'll need to handle code merges yourself during future upgrades.

### Sealos Usage Costs
