<Alert icon="🤖" context="success">
  - "6 versions of upgrade support" means you get upgrade assistance from the FastGPT team for 6 versions — not that the software stops working after 6 versions. Most upgrades are straightforward enough to handle yourself.
  - Fully managed is ideal for teams without dedicated ops staff — just focus on your product.
  - Self-hosted gives you full control over your own servers.
  - Single-node is great for small to mid-sized internal teams; you'll manage your own database backups.
  - High-availability is built for public-facing services, with monitoring, replicas, load balancing, and automated database backups.

## Technical Support

### App Customization

We can build custom workflow orchestrations tailored to your specific needs, delivered as a complete app. Pricing is negotiable based on scope.

### Technical Services (Custom Dev, Maintenance, Migration, Third-party Integration)

¥2,000–¥3,000 per person per day

### Upgrade Fees

Most upgrades just require pulling the new image and running the initialization script — no extra steps needed.

For cross-version or complex upgrades, you can follow the documentation to upgrade yourself, or pay for support at the standard technical service rate.

## FAQ

### How is delivery handled?

Full application = Community Edition image + Commercial Edition image

We'll provide a Commercial Edition image that requires a License to start.

### How does custom development work?

You can modify the Community Edition code, but the Commercial Edition image cannot be modified. Since the full version = Community Edition + Commercial Edition image, you can modify part of the codebase. However, if you fork the code, you'll need to handle code merges yourself during future upgrades.

### Sealos Usage Costs

Sealos cloud services are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Here's the pricing table:
